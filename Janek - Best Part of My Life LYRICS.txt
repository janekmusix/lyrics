Oh, I’ve been waiting for some time, for you.

Oh, I‘ve been lonely my whole life, without you.

But If I could take, if I could take a wish.
I would stay, I would stay with you.

Cause you're the best part of my life,
without you I would lose my mind.
You are my everything, my reason to sing.

Yeah you‘re the best part of my life,
without you I would lose myself.
Look at the stars, look how they shine for you, for you.

Oh, I’ve been searching,
for someone like you, so many times.

Oh, and now that I've found you, I won't let you go.
For the rest of my life.

But If I could take, if I could take a wish.
I would stay, I would stay with you.

Cause you're the best part of my life,
without you I would lose my mind.
You are my everything, my reason to sing.

Yeah you‘re the best part of my life,
without you I would lose myself.
Look at the stars, look how they shine for you, for you.
