[VERSE 1]

Sunday morning 7 am,
still feels like yesterday.

You came over sat next to me,
I got nervous and couldn't speak.

When I'm with you there's so much pressure,
when you're with me I'm someone else.

Can't clear my head, get rid of you,
I guess it won't change soon.


[HOOK]

Cause our friendship is something special.
Every time I see you, you make me lose my mind.
I see a million reasons why you are special,
a million reasons to ask you out.
But all I do is tryna get over you,
I’ve realised you’re just out of my league.


[VERSE 2]

All I ever dreamed of,
was to have someone like you.

Someone to hold on,
whatever conditions will be.

You gave me everything I needed,
you gave me love like no one could.

Now the memories are fading,
but I still wanna be with you.


[BRIDGE]

So many times I cried without you,
so many times you didnt care.
But in the end it doesnt matter,
I guess we‘d better let it be.


[HOOK]

Cause our friendship is something special.
Every time I see you, you make me lose my mind.
I see a million reasons why you are special,
a million reasons to ask you out.
But all I do is tryna get over you,
I’ve realised you’re just out of my league.
