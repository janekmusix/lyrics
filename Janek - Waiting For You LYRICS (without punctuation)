Hey you
How are you feeling
It's been two weeks since I’ve seen ya
But those two weeks felt like months to be honest even years
Don’t know why the sadness hits me when you’re not here

I think its crazy how quickly I fell in love with you
And I hope that you do love me too

Cause we could be together
From now until forever
could be having our best time
so tell me if you're fine with me
just giving you my love and making you my star
if you're not I'll wait till you are

Il wait for you (uh uh uh uh)
For you (uh uh uh uh uh)

Hey you
I think im addicted
To the smell of your perfume wish I could stay with you everyday
But now I'm 18teen and I'll change soon I'll be twenty two
But even then I‘d be waiting here for you

I think its crazy how quickly I fell in love with you
And I hope that you do love me too

Cause we could be together
From now until forever
could be having our best time
so tell me if you're fine with me
just giving you my love and making you my star
if you're not I'll wait till you are

Il wait for you (uh uh uh uh)
For you (uh uh uh uh uh)

Cause we could be together
From now until forever
could be having our best time
so tell me if you're fine with me
just giving you my love and making you my star
if you're not I'll wait till you are

Il wait for you (uh uh uh uh)
For you (uh uh uh uh uh)
