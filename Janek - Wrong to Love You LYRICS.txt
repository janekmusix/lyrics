It was wrong to say I love you, 
it wasn't right to say I'm fine,
but I don't think you'll ever find
a heart so sweet and bright like mine.

It was wrong to say it’s over,
it wasn’t right to say goodbye,
I can’t stop thinking all about you,
when I still got you on my mind.

You're telling me you're sorry,
but you keep going on.
It breaks my heart and drives me crazy,
to see you fall apart.

Your telling me to leave it all
and love you one more time.
But to love somebody else,
I have to love myself again.

And when we leave it all behind.
We’ll find ourselves out in the night.

It was wrong to say I love you,

It was wrong to say it’s over,
it wasn’t right to say goodbye,
I can’t stop thinking all about you,
when I still got you on my mind.

Im telling you to let it go,
but you keep fighting on.
Cause you know there’s no one else,
to hold you when you fall.

Im telling you to leave it all,
and find somebody else.
Cause I'm not the one, made for you,
to love you till the end.

And when we leave it all behind.
We’ll find ourselves out in the night.

It was wrong to say I love you, 
it wasn't right to say I'm fine,
but I don't think you'll ever find
a heart so sweet and bright like mine.

Tell me how am I supposed to live
without you by my side?
It's hard to let you go and find
a sweetheart just like mine.
